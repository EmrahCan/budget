Good morning, everyone!

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Today we're going to learn something new.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Programming can be fun and exciting.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,300
Let's start with the basics.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
First, we need to understand variables.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,800
Variables store data that we can use later.

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
